# .cursorrules

rules:
  - If you cannot find a component, module, or service in the current project folder named "fron",
    then look into the "./fuse-demo-v19.0.0" project for a similar implementation.
  - Copy the necessary component, dependencies, and imports from "./fuse-demo-v19.0.0"
    and adapt them so they work correctly inside the "fron" project structure and naming conventions.
  - Ensure all required modules, styles, and assets are included for compatibility.
  - Do not overwrite existing code unless it’s clearly outdated or redundant.
